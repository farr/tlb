# A Sufficient Condition for two Gravitational Waveforms to Furnish Equivalent Parameter Estimates

I derive a condition on the difference between two gravitational waveforms that is sufficient to guarantee that they will furnish equivalent parameter estimates in a Bayesian analysis.  The condition is that the log-likelihood difference between the two waveforms at the same point in parameter space is small.  I show that this condition is equivalent to the difference between the two waveforms being small compared to the signal-to-noise ratio of the waveforms; the condition does not require that either waveform be a good model for any signal in the data.
